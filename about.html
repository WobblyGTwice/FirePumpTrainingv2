      I have raecently retired from the Waterous Company having spent the last 30 plus years in the Service and 
      Training department. My career was spent developing, instructing and organizing our mechanic seminar
      programs. The program covered the theory, detrimental aspects operation/maintenance/overhaul and
      testing of Waterous fire pumps and accessories. I also developed and presented F3(Fire Pump and 
      Accessories) and F7 (Foam and CAFS) test preperation classes. I have been involved with the EVTs
      Certification Commission (F3 and F7) since 1999.

      The main focus of Prep Classes is pump, foam and caf systems oriented. Teaching how pump and 
      foam systems work, detrimental aspects, operation, maintenance, overhaul and testing provides a 
      overall working understanding.
